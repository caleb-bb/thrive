# Thrive
A game engine focused on small teams and procedural generation

## Agenda
Books:
1. *Command Line Rust* to learn the language.
2. *Strang's Linear Algebra*
3. *Foundations of Game Engine Development*, vols I and II.

As soon as we finish *Command Line Rust*, we need to begin working on the basics of the engine, even if we know very little to begin with.
